=============================
 Simple Miner for CPU mining
=============================

Simple Miner is a hight performance Cryptonight miner program for CPU mining. Our team is made it for simple using without editing config- or batch files.
This miner is free-to-use, however current developer fee is 1.0%. It means the program mining 99 minutes for the user and 1 minute for developers.
Our program based on XMRig miner.


System requirements
-------------------
Windows 7/8/8.1/10 x64 operation system


FEATURES
--------
* High performance

* Easy to use

* Reliable operation

* No need installation

* No need editing batch files or config files

* Supporting all Cryptonight algorithms (Monero, Electroneum, Sumokoin, etc.)

* Launch on Windows startup option

* Autostart mining option with custom delay

* Set to maximum CPU usage (when number of CPU thread option is auto)

* Virus and malware free

* Nicehash support


OPTIONS
-------
[Pool address]: URL of mining server (e.g. etnpool.sytes.net). Only Stratum protocol is supported.

[Port]: The port number of the pool (e.g. 7777)

[Wallet address]: Your wallet address

[Password]: Password for the pool. (default password is "x")

[Number of CPU threads]: When CPU is mining how many threads use. 0 value means using auto setting.

[Maximum CPU usage]: It is only available when the number of CPU threads option is 0 (auto).

[CPU affinity]: Set process affinity to CPU core(s). You can click on the auto config icon to determine what option is suit for you.

[Autostart mining]: Starts mining after launch Simple Miner.

[Starting delay (sec)]: Delay for Autostart mining option. It is useful when the miner program starts with Windows.

[Launch on Windows startup]: Simple Miner starts with Windows. (Don't forget turn on Autostart mining option with this!)

[Nicehash support]: Enable nicehash support if you wish mining into a Nicehash pool.

[Minimize to tray]: Simple Miner starts minimized.

[Log to a file]: The Simple Miner makes a log file into its directory.



Maximum performance checklist
-----------------------------
* Idle operating system

* Optimal thread count

* Use modern CPUs with AES-NI instructuon set

* Try setup optimal cpu affinity

* Enable fast memory (Large/Huge pages) (More details: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-the-lock-pages-in-memory-option-windows)
